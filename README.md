# Webflyx

**Webflyx** is a practice project developed to reinforce key Git concepts as part of the *Git Fundamentals* module from the Boot.dev course. The repository demonstrates version control practices such as repository setup, branching strategies, merging, rebasing, commit management, and collaboration using remote repositories.

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Setup and Configuration
    - Configured Git with user details and global settings.
    - Initialized local repositories and practiced basic Git operations.

### 2. Branching and Merging
- Created and managed feature branches to isolate development tasks.
- Merged feature branches into the main branch using both fast-forward and non-fast-forward merges.

### 3. Rebasing
- Applied rebasing techniques to maintain a linear and readable commit history.
- Gained practical understanding of the differences between `merge` and `rebase`.

### 4. Reset and Revert
- Learned to use `git reset` to move HEAD and preserve changes in the working directory.
- Practiced `git revert` to safely undo changes in the commit history.

### 5. Remote Repositories and GitHub
- Distinguished between local and remote repositories.
- Pushed commits to and pulled updates from a remote GitHub repository.
- Created and merged pull requests as part of collaborative development workflows.

### 6. .gitignore Usage
- Utilized `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from version control.

## Summary

This project provided hands-on experience with Git version control, helping to solidify a practical understanding of industry-standard workflows and best practices for managing source code in individual and collaborative settings.
