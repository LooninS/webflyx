# Webflyx

**Webflyx** is a practice project developed to reinforce key Git concepts as part of the *Git Fundamentals* module from the Boot.dev course. The repository demonstrates version control practices such as repository setup, branching strategies, merging, rebasing, commit management, and collaboration using remote repositories.

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Setup and Configuration
- Configured Git with user details and global settings.
- Initialized local repositories and practiced basic Git operations.

### 2. Branching and Merging
- Created and managed feature branches to isolate development tasks.
- Merged feature branches into the main branch using both fast-forward and non-fast-forward merges.

### 3. Rebasing
- Used rebase to keep a clean, linear commit history.
- Understood the difference between `merge` and `rebase`.

### 4. Reset and Revert
- Learned how to reset to a previous commit while keeping changes using `git reset --soft` & `git reset --hard`
### 5. Remote Repositories and GitHub
- Distinguished between local and remote repositories.
- Pushed commits to and pulled updates from a remote GitHub repository.
- Created and merged pull requests as part of collaborative development workflows.

### 6. .gitignore Usage
- Utilized `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from version control.

## Summary

This project provided hands-on experience with Git version control, helping to get a practical understanding of best practices for managing source code in individual and team settings.
